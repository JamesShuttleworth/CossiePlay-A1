<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> James Shuttleworth<br>
  <strong>Login:</strong> jc339993</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal in creating this website is to raise awareness of the CossiePlay business, and to get a younger demographic interested in cosplay. This will help to increase both the number of people who attend the cosplay parties, and the people who enlist the help of CossiePlay to create their custom costumes.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The site's success will be evaluated in two ways. The first way is by counting the number of people who attend the CossiePlay parties; in particular younger people, as the business would like to attract a younger audience. By comparing the counts of young people across different parties, we will be able to see whether or not there has been an increase in attendance by young people since the websites inception. Another way the success will be measured is by counting the number of people who buy/sell their costumes with CossiePlay or get them custom made after the site is up and running. This is the best way to measure the success of the website as the main goal of the site is to raise awareness of the business and to get more clients. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website is anyone who is interested in cosplay, but the site should mainly appeal to a younger audience in order to get younger people interested in cosplay. In order to appeal to a younger audience, the website will use bright and vibrant colours as well as using plenty of pictures showing other cosplaying youths. Content on the website will be centered in order to draw the viewer's eye, and text will be kept short and sweet so that the user doesn't have to read through large chunks of text to see what the site is offering.</p>
